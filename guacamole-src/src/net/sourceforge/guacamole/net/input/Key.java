/**
 * Servlet which accepts keyboard input events, forwards these events to the
 * VNC client associated with the session, and returns the result (if any)
 * to the HTTP client via XML.
 *
 * This servlet takes three parameters:
 *      index:    The event index. As HTTP requests may arrive out of order,
 *                this index provides the event queue with a means of sorting
 *                events, and determining if events are missing. The first
 *                event has index 0.
 *      pressed:  Whether the key was pressed (1) or released (0).
 *      keysym:   The integer representing the corresponding X11 keysym.
